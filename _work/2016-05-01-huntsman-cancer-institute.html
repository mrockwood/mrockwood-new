{% capture text %}Huntsman Cancer Institue is one of the nation's leading cancer hospitals and research facilities.
My challenge was to update their website with a fresh look on a tight timeline.{% endcapture %}

	<p>This project was initiated when Vice President Joe Biden scheduled a visit to the Huntsman Cancer Institue (HCI) as part of his &ldquo;moonshot&rdquo; cure for cancer.
	Expecting a surge in interest, HCI wanted a modern, usable website ready for new visitors.
	With a hard deadline and many interested parties involved, I was able to transform designer Drew Corkill's work into a clean, friendly, content-driven web experience.</p>
